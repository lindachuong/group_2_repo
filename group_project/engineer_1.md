Reproducibility Status:
The GitHub repository provides the consensus expression matrix, metadata, differential expression results, and the primary WGCNA script used in the publication. However, the repository does not include the full set of output files generated during the original analysis (e.g., WGCNA module outputs, final figures, intermediate QC results). Because these output files are missing, it is not currently possible to directly compare newly generated results to the authors’ original outputs. While the code appears functional, full replication requires re-running all analyses and inferring missing steps, which may lead to differences from the published results.
