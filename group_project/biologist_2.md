Summary: The paper was found on Nature. The paper explores the mechanism how the brain learns to like or dislike the taste of soemthing after eating it. Through mice
experimentation, they induces food poisinong on the mice associated with a food and observed the gut-brain signaling mechanism that induces a learning memory for the gut to
reactivate that memory. The github generates the compuational data with figures, tables, and brain-wide cell detection pipeline.
