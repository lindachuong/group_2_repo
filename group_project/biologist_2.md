Summary: The paper was found on Nature. The paper explores the mechanism how the brain learns to like or dislike the taste of soemthing after eating it. Through mice
experimentation, they induces food poisinong on the mice associated with a food and observed the gut-brain signaling mechanism that induces a learning memory for the gut to
reactivate that memory. The github generates the compuational data with figures, tables, and brain-wide cell detection pipeline.

Summary: This paper evaluates the generalizability of machine learning classifiers on resting-state fMRI data for Autism (N=988), ADHD (N=930), PTSD (N=87), and Alzheimer’s disease (N=132). The authors applied 18 classifiers and showed that overfitting is a major problem in heterogeneous datasets. To improve robustness, they proposed a consensus classifier that combines all 18 models, reducing sensitivity to age or site differences. Feature importance scores from all classifiers were aggregated to identify discriminative and robust functional connectivity patterns. The MALINI MATLAB toolbox implements these classifiers and the consensus model, enabling reproducible analyses and visualization of neuroimaging-based diagnostic predictions.
