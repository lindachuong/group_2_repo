Summary: The paper was found on Nature. The paper explores the mechanism how the brain learns to like or dislike the taste of soemthing after eating it. Through mice
experimentation, they induces food poisinong on the mice associated with a food and observed the gut-brain signaling mechanism that induces a learning memory for the gut to
reactivate that memory. The github generates the compuational data with figures, tables, and brain-wide cell detection pipeline.

Summary: This paper evaluates the generalizability of machine learning classifiers on resting-state fMRI data for Autism (N=988), ADHD (N=930), PTSD (N=87), and Alzheimer’s disease (N=132). The authors applied 18 classifiers and showed that overfitting is a major problem in heterogeneous datasets. To improve robustness, they proposed a consensus classifier that combines all 18 models, reducing sensitivity to age or site differences. Feature importance scores from all classifiers were aggregated to identify discriminative and robust functional connectivity patterns. The MALINI MATLAB toolbox implements these classifiers and the consensus model, enabling reproducible analyses and visualization of neuroimaging-based diagnostic predictions.

Journal of Biomedical Informatics 145 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2023.104460

Summary: Summary: This paper introduces the knowledge graph named GENA (Graph of mEntal‑health and Nutrition Association) which encodes relationships between nutrition (foods, biochemicals) and mental health disorders, by mining PubMed abstracts. The authors applied a hybrid named‑entity recognition (NER) model followed by a deep syntax‑based relation‑extraction model to identify entities and binary relations from abstracts. 
 The resulting graph contains 43,367 relations, about 94.04 % of which are novel (i.e., not present in existing food‑disease ontologies).
 GENA is implemented using the Neo4j database to allow intuitive querying and exploration of how nutritional factors may relate to mental‑health conditions. The publicly released GitHub repository enables access to both code and data, supporting reproducibility and reuse of this resource.

Zhang, L., Li L., et al. MMASleepNet: A multimodal attention network based on electrophysiological signals for automatic sleep staging. 
Frontiers in Neuroscience 16 (2022). https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.973761


Website Link: https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.973761/full

Github Link: https://github.com/buptantEEG/MMASleepNet/

Summary: This paper introduces the deep-learning architecture MMASleepNet, which uses EEG, EOG, and EMG signals in a multi‐branch feature extraction module plus an attention‐based fusion module (modal-wise squeeze-and-excitation + Transformer encoder) to improve automatic sleep staging. The model was tested on publicly available datasets (Sleep-EDF, ISRUC-Sleep) and outperformed prior methods in accuracy, F1-score and κ metrics. The GitHub repository provides the implementation, enabling reproducibility of multimodal electrophysiological sleep staging.
