The computational approach that the authors are proposing to use
The authors propose a computational approach centered on AlphaFold, a deep learning system that predicts protein structures with near-experimental accuracy. Unlike prior physics-based or purely evolutionary methods, AlphaFold integrates both biological and physical constraints into a novel neural network architecture. Its design leverages multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and structural templates as inputs, processed through the “Evoformer” module, which models evolutionary and spatial relationships, followed by a structure module that directly outputs 3D atomic coordinates. The system incorporates iterative refinement (“recycling”), equivariant attention to respect geometric invariances, and self-distillation to exploit vast unlabeled sequence data. This hybrid strategy allows AlphaFold to generate highly accurate, end-to-end predictions of full protein structures even when no close structural homologues are available
