Looking at the GitHub repository for DeepMind's "Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold," there are a couple of reasons why the study’s findings cannot be fully replicated using the repository alone. While the pretrained model weights are publicly available, they are not included directly in the repository and must be downloaded separately. The exact protein sequence and structure databases used in the study may also be inaccessible, which can affect the results. Differences in hardware, such as GPU type and memory, as well as variations in software environments and library versions, can further influence outcomes. Additionally, stochastic elements in the model, like random initialization and dropout, may cause variability between runs. Finally, certain preprocessing or postprocessing steps used in the study are not fully documented, making exact replication challenging for someone trying to replicate.
