1. Biological problem the authors are trying to solve
The biological problem that the authors are trying to solve is predicting and modeling 3d protein structures from their amino acid sequence. This will allow for a better understanding of how protein structure determines its function and its role in biological systems. So far, only a tiny fraction of protein structures are known out of the billions of protein sequences. This creates a gap in research between the known sequences and their known structure. If the structures are mapped, can more research be put into utilizing the structures rather than just figuring out the structure and its foldings.
