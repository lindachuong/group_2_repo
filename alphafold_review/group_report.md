1. Biological problem the authors are trying to solve The biological problem that the authors are trying to solve is predicting and modeling 3d protein structures from their amino acid sequence. This will allow for a better understanding of how protein structure determines its function and its role in biological systems. So far, only a tiny fraction of protein structures are known out of the billions of protein sequences. This creates a gap in research between the known sequences and their known structure. If the structures are mapped, can more research be put into utilizing the structures rather than just figuring out the structure and its foldings.

3. In the paper, the authors rely on a few key references to support their research. One of them is CASP, which was mentioned many times, especially at the beginning of the paper. CASP was an experiment which was used to test the effectiveness of the AlphaFold in predicting protein structure, and the authors found that it was very accurate compared to other models. It also relies on the Protein Data Bank, which is a public repository of protein structures. This was first mentioned on the first page of the paper and reappears many times. The PDB was primarily used as a training data set for AlphaFold. Other references that were also heavily mentioned and discussed include multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and Evoformer.
4. Looking at the GitHub repository for DeepMind's "Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold," there are a couple of reasons why the studyâ€™s findings cannot be fully replicated using the repository alone. While the pretrained model weights are publicly available, they are not included directly in the repository and must be downloaded separately. The exact protein sequence and structure databases used in the study may also be inaccessible, which can affect the results. Differences in hardware, such as GPU type and memory, as well as variations in software environments and library versions, can further influence outcomes. Additionally, stochastic elements in the model, like random initialization and dropout, may cause variability between runs. Finally, certain preprocessing or postprocessing steps used in the study are not fully documented, making exact replication challenging for someone trying to replicate.
