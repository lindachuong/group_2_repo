1. Biological problem the authors are trying to solve The biological problem that the authors are trying to solve is predicting and modeling 3d protein structures from their amino acid sequence. This will allow for a better understanding of how protein structure determines its function and its role in biological systems. So far, only a tiny fraction of protein structures are known out of the billions of protein sequences. This creates a gap in research between the known sequences and their known structure. If the structures are mapped, can more research be put into utilizing the structures rather than just figuring out the structure and its foldings.

4.Looking at the GitHub repository for DeepMind's "Highly accurate protein 
structure prediction with AlphaFold," there are a couple of reasons why the 
studyâ€™s findings cannot be fully replicated using the repository alone. While 
the pretrained model weights are publicly available, they are not included 
directly in the repository and must be downloaded separately. The exact protein 
sequence and structure databases used in the study may also be inaccessible, 
which can affect the results. Differences in hardware, such as GPU type and 
memory, as well as variations in software environments and library versions, 
can further influence outcomes. Additionally, stochastic elements in the model, 
like random initialization and dropout, may cause variability between runs. 
Finally, certain preprocessing or postprocessing steps used in the study are 
not fully documented, making exact replication challenging for someone trying 
to replicate.
