In the paper, the authors rely on a few key references to support their research. One of them is CASP, which was mentioned many times, especially at the beginning of the paper. CASP was an experiment which was used to test the effectiveness of the AlphaFold in predicting protein structure, and the authors found that it was very accurate compared to other models. It also relies on the Protein Data Bank, which is a public repository of protein structures. This was first mentioned on the first page of the paper and reappears many times. The PDB was primarily used as a training data set for AlphaFold. Other references that were also heavily mentioned and discussed include multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and Evoformer.
